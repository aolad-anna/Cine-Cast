An over-the-top media service is a media service offered directly to viewers via the Internet. OTT bypasses cable, broadcast, and satellite television platforms, the types of companies that traditionally act as controllers or distributors of such content.

OTT Platform is a brand new mode of entertainment in Bangladesh. OTT Platforms popularity has accelerated due to the availability of the internet and the changes in peopleâ€™s tastes. At present, 4k TV, HD smart TVs have become very popular among the upper and middle class.

People are very upset because of the extra commercial breaks of Bangladeshi satellite television channels and the broadcast of valueless, dishonourable dramas and movies. While entertainment-loving people were waiting for an alternative medium, the ad-free HD video streaming contents of the OTT platforms have become a wonderful source of entertainment for people. Originals, Movies, Web Series have become very popular among the people due to less censored content.
